## Overview
<p>
Post office mail is a basic communication between members of Palestinian institutions,
as there is a continuous and strong need for communication whether between Palestine
and other countries or within the country itself.</p>
<p>
Whereas the ministry of communications and information technology seeks to meet all
the requirements of employees and clients in more than one hundred offices distributed
throughout the West Bank to organize exchange operations, documenting, and
auditing. Thus, all of these operations will be converted into computerized operations
away from the traditional paper-based methods. Also, it seeks to find virtual boxes
representing those boxes in the local post office to make it easier for clients to monitor
post office boxes.</p>

## Problem & Solution

<p>
Postal service development and its consolidation have led to an increasing number of services for the citizens which means the organization must automate operations if it is to serve them effectively. Postal tracking is completed in two ways, the first way is to fall under a standard system (UPU), and enter the tracking number to get the tracking result of your shipment, including the dates, locations, country of origin, and destination. The second method uses the EXCEL program where the data for the package is manually added (non-standard) and this cannot be entered into the international tracking system. Additionally, some clients should reserve a mailbox and track this box periodically which results in some complications and wasted time.</p>
<p>
Mail operations will be simplified and employees will be able to track packages more easily through a website/application similar to the international postal system mainly for packages with tracking numbers non-standard where they are exported, distributed, and archived electronically.</p>

## Why !
When I was in my final year of university, I faced the problem of not being able to track my postal packages. This inspired me to do my graduation project on how to improve the Palestinian Post. I contacted the Palestinian Ministry of Communications and worked with them to create a demo site that would allow users to track their packages. The features of this demo site were later added to the main system on the [official Palestinian Post website](https://www.palpost.ps/).
